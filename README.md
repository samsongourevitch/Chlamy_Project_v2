# Chlamy_Project_v2

This repository contains the code used for the analysis of the data collected by Dr Adrien Burlacot's lab. 

It contains two folder : 
  Scripts
  Notebooks

The scripts folder contains the .py files with the main functions used in the folder notebooks.
The notebooks folder contains different jupyter nootebooks. Most of them are exploration of the data and are rather unstructured. All the results, ie the extraction of interesting genes and the gene clustering, can be generated by the 'gene_clustering' notebook. 

However it relies on preprocessed data that we cannot attached to this repository because of the size of the file but generated by the function 'get_format_data_without_na' with the argument 'phase1', 'phase2' or 'transition' depending on which data we want to load of the 'Data_v2.py' file in the scripts folder.
